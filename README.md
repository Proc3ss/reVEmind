reVEmind
========

EveOnline Combat Log Analyzer - v0.1a


  Get Started:


    Download the windows_build.zip
    
    Extract it to a_folder
    
    Run reVEmind.exe
  
  
  
  First Time Running:
  
  
    File > Select Folder (something like 'EVE\logs\Gamelogs' )
    
    Actions > Import All Files
    
    wait a while - especially if you have alot of logs, the program has never locked up on me here so if it beomes
    non-responsive.. continue to wait until it allows you to select a date(one that has been imported)
  
  After That:
  
    You will still need to import future logs, however the log folder should be saved. So all you need to do next time
    is just 'Actions > Import'
    
    


Code Usage:
    import reVEmind
    reVEmind.run() ##runs gui app
